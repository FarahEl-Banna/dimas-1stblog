If The Coin Had Been Flipped, or Bizzaro Layan 

Layan’s life is all about butterflies, blue glasses, and happy times. Usually, Layan is thrilled at the prospects of the future she envisions for herself. 

Living in a small village with all the limitations that uphold it, Layan dreams of a limitless world. That is often envisioned when she goes to the pastures and the small waterfall near the village’s river. She
envisions herself perched atop a lofty crag, scanning the vista for a forthcoming army of bats, or ambling down the helical staircase adjacent to the entrance of an arcane fortress made of stone at the bottom of the waterfall. 

Her mother’s words, yet, jolt her out of her reverie, and she finds herself drifting along the Niagara Falls. 

"Layan, I love you; you are very special to me." Layan’s mother adored her the most of all her siblings. 

It is not known whether her mother loves her or if it is only because Layan is so obedient. Her mother, an articulate individual who often conformed to traditional social standards and had a constant battle with weight loss, expected a lot out of Layan as an end result. 

Her mother wanted her to be the first in class when she was in school. During the summer school play, she wanted her to be the lead actor. And in college, she wanted her to be the most aspiring political
activist. 

Her mother presses upon her the expectations of being a "girl" expected by the society in which they live, which involve marrying and bearing children. Not that she objects to that. 

Layan, on the other hand, desired to love and to be at ease in her relationships. she was always sympathetic to her mother, and she understood her motives, so for that, she plays along with her.  

Layan was looking for work as a biochemist after graduating from college. Her mother thought it prestigous to hold a degree but not necessarily in what, or if she works as holding a degree would increase her daughter's value and aid her in landing a wealthy husband. 

Though Layan aspired to start her career, she abondoned that idea when her prince charming came knocking at her door and fulfill herself by becoming a "wife," just as her mother would have wanted. 

To say that Layan’s dream was to wear the big wedding dress is an understatement; it was all that she and her mother talked about. It was one of the few subjects she broached upon her mother, and it was her way of seeking approval from her. 

No matter how enticing and rewarding a research doctorate may have been or how proficient she would be in her field of expertise, at that fateful moment in her life, Layan and her mother made a
choice that she would never regret, or at least that is what her mother proclaimed. 

Though she wasn’t entirely convinced at the start of their relationship, her husband was persistent. And Layan began to rely on his approval. And she would find comfort in knowing that her life would revolve around him. It doesn't matter what Layan's thoughts are about how the relationship should be because she is dependent on her mother's opinion in these matters, suffice it to say that her mother only cares that her son-in-law is the sustenance to their family. And it is "How mother wanted things to be". 

She relied on her mother in all her relationships with men and confided in her a lot of times. However, she was aware that her mother’s involvement in their relationship would cause the agreement to be on shaky ground. 

And when her husband came for his first visit, bearing flowers and pastries for her mother, as per Layan's request, she was appeased by his gentlemanly manner. 

To the stark contrast of Layan's taste in men,for she liked the eccentric type—the poets, the musicians, and the talented—and most of them were beggars at the time. Her fiancé was "a good guy," and that is all that she had to say about him. 

He was very generous, often taking them out formeals at his own expense and even gifting her mother a golden brooch.
Despite his plump figure, her mother was so taken with him that she said to her, "And what of it?" "I might not like fish, but when it's served, I eat it." Or that is what she said to keep her daughter’s dismay
at bay. 

Life had been going well for Layan, who, in her estimation, was engaged to a charming fiancé and had apparently attained the life she almost surely wanted. 

Though, her older sister pointed out that he lacked confidence, which Layan was concerned about, worrying that it could affect their life together. For, she had always struggled with low self-esteem, and
she saw that as an attribute to her father’s reluctant personality. And yes, she was worried about how that would impact her children. Often times she pondered on the thought of why bring a child into this world to suffer. 

But their mother quickly reassured her, saying that all kids need is a little bit of attention and to be well taken care of financially. And well, that's it, "full stop." The argument was settled, and Layan, though reluctant, was assuaged. 

She took the bait, much to the delight of her sister, who just hates to be smothered by her mother. 

Ultimately, the couple wed and had three children—two girls, Joy, who is seen as rude and insolent by her grandma, while Pearl is seen as timid and lacking in personality, and Dany, the boy, who is the pride and joy of his granny. 

While her husband sleeps, Layan rises early to send her kids off to school. After that, she has a 9 o'clock meeting with the board members of the ladies' charity association, which her mother attends, but she can’t help but interject in the discussion even though she is not a member. 

Layan's cousin is a beloved member of the institution, and she has kick-started relationships between it and other recipient corporations; in fact, she was responsible for Layan's nomination as chairperson. Reflectively, her mother always disclosed a special fondness for her cousin - something unfathomable - but her mother often showed such strong emotions towards her sister’s children that Layan couldn’t help but envy. Above all else, Layan's mom practically holds her cousin on a pedestal. 

Her mother continually inspired her to contribute to social reforms and chair the Women’s Benevolence Society. The women decided to confront topics focalizing on empowerment of women, yet seemingly contradictory in comparison since they partnered up with political parties advocating patriarchal laws that show favorability towards men. 

After the meetings, she and her mother go to visit distant relatives. Over coffee, her mother speaks highly of Layan's husband, describing how he always indulged her with compliments about her
cooking. 

One story in particular that her mother always told was about her son-in-law's thoughtfulness when selecting Layan's wedding dress. Despite Layan's contentment with the dress, her husband had a new one made for her after her mother expressed her dissatisfaction with the designer's work. The bragging about the wedding doesn’t stop there, for mother wore a cocktail dress evocative of the attire sported by Othman Empire empresses. 

During those visits, her mother was always delighted when the conversations shifted to "scandalous
rumors," especially about a woman who had recently separated from her husband or a young girl usually assumed to have lost her purity. Additionally, while talking over these stories she also would mention memories of escorting Layan during dates with her well-thought husband-to-be as crafty approaches to teaching the need for manners and honorable etiquette. 

A spinster—sinister—who spends her time reading magazines and rarely takes care of her overly demanding mother always gets to be part of the rumors that are talked about over coffee visits.
Surprisingly, that same spinster is also a writer for the magazine she loves to read so much.  

There is rarely a discussion about successful, independent, and bold women, except for
those who partake in the maintenance of society as it is, such as Layan and her cousin. 

At every visit, the discussion never fails to turn to bodies—both in regards to physique and body shaming. Layan is praised for her slender and fit figure, but her mother is always quick to remind her of
the importance of not eating sugar and avoiding bread. Because mother knows best and she presumably considers herself "very well-learned" when it comes to health and what to eat. Hence, she gives lengthy lectures to her and her siblings about the subject. 

At 31, Layan  was living the life of her dreams, presumably with the most loving mother. And her timid sweet, Pearl, the only child she got away with naming. 

Alas, laying on her bed in her 150-dollar flat in Beirut, she was relieved to not be living the Bizzaro life. Taking a momentary reprieve from her haunting nightmare, she headed to the staircase, then leapt onto her motorcycle to meet with her boyfriend—or rather, the "talented-beggar"—that lived three blocks away.
