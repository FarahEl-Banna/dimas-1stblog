## Overall Review of House Of The Dragon
### Writer's Intake

From the very beginning, the show openly addresses its main concern of sexism in a culture run on male supremacy - making pellucid in the premiere 'The Council 101'. The suggestion that a woman's destiny is merely consigned to maternity and not playing a decision-making part was articulated by Rhaenyra's mum with “a women’s fight is in pregnancy precincts, while men’s exists in confrontation arenas" upon which Rhaenyra resiliently voices her

Gender discrimination is a prevalent topic in the A Song of Ice and Fire series. We observe this with Brienne of Tarth, a female whose predefined social role involved wearing fine dress es, singing melodies, and waiting for her father to betroth her to an esteemed lord; instead she took it upon herself to learn the skills necessary for defending herself within the framework of a patriarchal system. Similarly, Ygritte acquired survival tactics while Cersei and Margaret made do with their experiences in cunning

I liked that the season had a twist in the events for example in terms of knowing it started of as a documentary but actually it started to turn into something exciting, I love the fact that the first episode showed the birth scene and showed the creativity and the embodiment and the reality of showing an actual birth like this is what happens in real life women, and what women go through and especially that they are showing a paradox of how men fight in the battle field like it’s all set down straight it’s sexism at the best.

I think George R martin meant to in all his writings to stick to a certain paradigm of thinking which is to existentialism, for example Martin’s character are out to choose between black and white however they at often times chose outside the box something unexpected their motives at times comes not from what systematically happened but what they value most by that they aren’t bound to a certain mode of living or circumstances but they make the choice to follow their heart to care to love and to be happy. A kind of bizarre twist to how Westeros is actually built and the brutality that is embodied in the show.



## Rhaenyra
### Stark contrast to Alicent 

Rhaenyra, the dark monarch, epitomizes teenage recalcitrance; she abhors the predefined role assigned to her by society. Armored on her dragon back is what gives her adoration. 

Despite how coarsely she was portrayed in Blood and Fire, the showrunners did an exceptional job at exposing her gentle motherhood that flourishes because of how devotedly attached in contrary to the relation Alicent has with her kids. 




## Daemon
### Rogue Prince

The plot of House of the dragon mesmerizes readers by entirety. That we find the variables and different characters to create what is so much likened to a sexism the motivation to decide on what path to take for the different character is fueled but nothing but the deep desire for power a desire to reign over we see Daemon as a cautious man though he is called upon as the rogue Prince but actually he is far from rogue and so much as someone who seeks for attention and validation. Though he gets what he wants but is not happy about it. 

The Rogue Prince, is an ominous and enigmatic figure who adheres to no one else's guidelines and acts on retaliatory impulses spurred by his brother's failure to properly rule and his incapacity for actual kingship.

His aim is to revive the Targaryen dynasty's pre-eminence in Westeros and be at the top. Unfortunately, his soaring high impression of his own capability encounters a flip of overturn when he finds himself entrenched in the shady and fast changing lifestyle of an uncertain life.

He has found joy in solitude for 10 consecutive years during which his resolve remained strong and his observation keen, pondering over ways to revive Westeros by delving deeper into history about dragons.
